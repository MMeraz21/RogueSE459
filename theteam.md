Manuel Meraz
Hello!  My name is Manuel and I am currently in the final quarter of my degree.  I enjoy working on fullstack and mobile projects when I code in my free time.

Nimisha Bhoir, Heya!! As a passionate Computer Science master's student in my second-to-last quarter, I thrive on coding and exploring innovative solutions. My love for problem-solving drives me to continuously grow and challenge myself in the ever-evolving tech world.
